<p><b>ZeroSum</b> is a rock paper scissors game appication where the computer plays the Rock-Paper-Scissors game against a human player </p>
<p>When a human player plays the game, the human’s choices are not truly random. (Assume the human player isn’t using dice to determine choices.) If during a match the computer records sequences of the last N throw choices ending with the human’s choice,
it can detect patterns and thus attempt to predict what the human will choose next</p>
